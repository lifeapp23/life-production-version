,"workoutSetup":"1.Start Position Place your feet between hip and shoulder-width apart, and turn your feet out a few degreesThink about how youd stand to do a vertical jumpthats the stance you want to use for the power snatch(Youre going to maximally accelerate the bar upward, which is not unlike trying to jump as high as you can).2.First Pull This is the portion of the lift that goes from the moment the bar leaves the floor until its just below your knees.Push your feet down so that your hips and knees begin to extend and the bar breaks off the floorYou should feel your weight start on your mid-foot and shift to your heels as you lift.3.Transition Phase The transition phase is when the bar passes the kneesThe goal here is to position the body so you can create maximum acceleration with the barWhen the first pull is done correctly and the bar is close to you, your knees will make room for the bar to pass when you extend your legs.4.Second Pull Heres where that powerful triple extension comes in.5Catch Now the goal is to safely catch the bar overhead.6.Recovery Once you have control of the bar, stand up straight and tall with it overhead, and your arms locked out."
,"performingWorkout":" 1Starting Position place your feet shoulder width apart grab the barbell with a wide gripensure your back is flatdistribute your weight on your heelsfor proper hand placement, you should stand with the barbell at your waist and be holding it with straight armsyour toes may even be slightly off the ground because the weight should be on your heels2.The Pull lift the barbell off the ground, while keeping it very close to your legskeep your back flat (do not hunch as this can cause injury)continue the momentum of the barbell up your legs3.The Pop This is the most important step in performing a power snatch and can be the most difficult once the barbell reaches your waist, you need to drive your hips forward with a lot of forcethe barbell should shoot off your body and it needs to go straight upkeep the barbell close to your body as it moves over your headmany people tend to pop the barbell straight out instead of upThis makes it difficult to maneuver your body under the barbell4.The Receive This is where a snatch and a power snatch differ:maintain a straight or even slightly hyperextended backarms should be straight and knees bent slightly (if the knees are bent more than 90 degrees, the lift would then be considered a snatch)receive the barbell a little behind your head (the reason is because this is where your center of gravity is)TipQuestionComment 5.The Finish This is the final step in the power snatch: once you have received the barbell over your head, all that is left is to stand straight upthe lift does not count unless you stand up with the weight over your headfeet should still be shoulder width apartthe barbell can either be dropped if over proper flooring (such as a lifting mat) or returned the same way to the floor as was lifted6.ConsiderationsBefore performing this movement, you should be very comfortable with lifting weightA PVC pipe is a good starting point to learn the mechanics of the power snatch before advancing to a barbell (which weighs 45 pounds)Plates (weight) can then be added as the athlete is able to lift heavier amounts.This is not a simple lift and should be practiced with minimal weightThe athlete should also know how to properly bail out of the lift in case he or she is unable to safely perform the movement"

,"performingWorkout":"1.To perfectly execute the regular jump rope bounce, you will need to keep your arms to your sides as you use your wrists to rotate the rope, jumping with both feet together and landing both at the same timeDon't excessively move your shoulders or elbows, and be sure to bounce on the balls of your feet."
