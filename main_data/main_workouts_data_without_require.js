Think about how you�d stand to do a vertical jump�that�s the stance you want to use for the Power Snatch. (You�re going to maximally accelerate the bar upward, which is not unlike trying to jump as high as you can).\n\n2.First Pull This is the portion of the lift that goes from the moment the bar leaves the floor until it�s just below your knees.\n\nPush your feet down so that your hips and knees begin to extend and the bar breaks off the floor. You should feel your weight start on your mid-foot and shift to your heels as you lift.\n3.Transition Phase The transition phase is when the bar passes the knees. The goal here is to position the body so you can create maximum acceleration with the bar. When the first pull is done correctly and the bar is close to you, your knees will make room for the bar to pass when you extend your legs.\n4.Second Pull Here�s where that powerful triple extension comes in.\n5. Catch Now the goal is to safely catch the bar overhead.\n6.Recovery Once you have control of the bar, stand up straight and tall with it overhead, and your arms locked out.",
      "performingWorkout": " 1. Starting Position place your feet shoulder width apart grab the barbell with a wide grip\nensure your back is flat\ndistribute your weight on your heels\nfor proper hand placement, you should stand with the barbell at your waist and be holding it with straight arms\nyour toes may even be slightly off the ground because the weight should be on your heels\n2.The Pull lift the barbell off the ground, while keeping it very close to your legs\nkeep your back flat (do not hunch as this can cause injury)\ncontinue the momentum of the barbell up your legs\n3.The Pop This is the most important step in performing a Power Snatch and can be the most difficult once the barbell reaches your waist, you need to drive your hips forward with a lot of force\nthe barbell should shoot off your body and it needs to go straight up\nkeep the barbell close to your body as it moves over your head\nmany people tend to pop the barbell straight out instead of up. This makes it difficult to maneuver your body under the barbell\n4.The Receive This is where a snatch and a Power Snatch differ:\nmaintain a straight or even slightly hyperextended back\narms should be straight and knees bent slightly (if the knees are bent more than 90 degrees, the lift would then be considered a snatch)\nreceive the barbell a little behind your head (the reason is because this is where your center of gravity is)\nTipQuestionComment\n 5.The Finish This is the final step in the Power Snatch: once you have received the barbell over your head, all that is left is to stand straight up\nthe lift does not count unless you stand up with the weight over your head\nfeet should still be shoulder width apart\nthe barbell can either be dropped if over proper flooring (such as a lifting mat) or returned the same way to the floor as was lifted\n\n6.Considerations\nBefore performing this movement, you should be very comfortable with lifting weight. A PVC pipe is a good starting point to learn the mechanics of the Power Snatch before advancing to a barbell (which weighs 45 pounds). Plates (weight) can then be added as the athlete is able to lift heavier amounts.\nThis is not a simple lift and should be practiced with minimal weight. The athlete should also know how to properly bail out of the lift in case he or she is unable to safely perform the movement",

You can get into this start position by deadlifting the barbell from the floor, or set up the barbell at knee height in a power rack and perform a rack pull, then step out of the rack. \n2.The short version of the form guide is that you push your hips back to lower the barbell, keeping it close to your legs, then drive your hips forwards to return to the start.\n3.Here�s Hoobler with the finer points of the movement. �Let your hips unlock and push them backwards to begin the movement, keeping your spine neutral throughout,� says Hoobler.  �The hips need to unlock before the knees. This means sending the hips backwards first, then unlocking [or slightly softening] the knees as you lower the weight.�\n4.Your ability to keep the bar close to your legs �is linked to the unlocking of the hips,� says Hoobler. �The further your hips go back, the closer you can keep the bar to your body. From a hang position, you should let the bar graze your thighs as you lower it. Stop when your hamstrings will no longer let you move without further bending your knees or spine � then you come back up.�",

First of all, they�re low-intensity, which makes them great even for those who are suffering from upper back pain. Second, they never take more than a couple of minutes to do, which means that you don�t have an excuse for skipping the stretch before the exercise. While some can be completed as soon as you get out of your bed, some, as you could have seen, you don�t even need to leave your bed for.\n2.Nonetheless, if the pain is too sharp even while doing some of the lighter exercises, it might be a good idea that you contact spine doctors in NJ and get their opinion.\n3.This article was reviewed and approved by an orthopedic surgeon as we place a high premium on accuracy for our patients and potential patients.",

While maintaining your alignment, begin the downward movement by bending your hips, knees, and ankles. Allow your arms to travel in front of your body as you lower into the squat position.\n4. Lower until your legs are parallel or slightly below parallel with the floor. Only lower as far as you can maintain a level pelvis and keep the weight on your feet evenly distributed. Imagine that your pelvis is a bucket filled with water and you�re attempting not to spill any of it. Pause at the bottom position.\n5. To begin the upward movement, push your feet into the ground to initiate standing up. Place emphasis on pushing through your mid-foot and heel while keeping your toes engaged. Keep your chest high and squeeze your glutes as you allow your knees to straighten and your hips to travel forward. Allow your arms to travel back toward your sides.\n6. As you finish the movement, squeeze your glutes and quadriceps while maintaining a neutral spine. At the end of each repetition, your shoulders should finish directly over your hips.",
